Hello, this is a test of the microphone and transcription system.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.660
I am speaking clearly to check if every word is captured.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.520
Now I will pause for a moment to test the silence detection.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.720
After the pause, I will continue speaking to see if the system resumes correctly.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.440
Finally, I will end this test and press Ctrl C to stop the recording.
