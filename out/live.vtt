Hello, this is

00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:05.822
test of the microphone and transcription system.

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:12.584
I am speaking clearly to check if every word is captured.

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.933
Now I will pause for a

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:16.192
moment to test the silence.

00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:17.312
detection.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:18.753
after the pause.

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:22.713
I will continue speaking to see if the system resumes correctly.

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:34.082
Finally, I will end this test and press Ctrl-C to switch to the test.

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:34.084
stop recording.
