# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
LoquiLex is pre-1.0; we support the latest commit on `main` and the most recent tagged release (if any).

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Prefer **Private Vulnerability Reporting** via GitHub:
  - https://github.com/Guffawaffle/LoquiLex/security/advisories/new
- If that is unavailable, open a minimal **Security** issue without PoC details and request a maintainer contact, or use the contact info on the maintainerâ€™s GitHub profile.
- We aim to acknowledge within **72 hours** and will coordinate a fix and disclosure window as appropriate.

## Security Posture
- Automated checks: CodeQL (code scanning), Dependabot & Dependency Review (supply chain), gitleaks (secrets), OpenSSF Scorecards (posture).
- We welcome hardening suggestions via issues or PRs.
