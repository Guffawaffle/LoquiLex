# Docs: Architecture Guide, Contracts, Troubleshooting

Parent: #60

## Summary
Document the JS-first architecture, versioned contracts, and common troubleshooting scenarios (offline mode, disk space, permissions).

## Goals
- `docs/architecture/js-first.md` with boundaries: **JS orchestrates; Python executes**.
- `docs/contracts/*.md` for REST/WS schemas (downloads, device-test, exports).
- Troubleshooting page for offline-first behavior and typical errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Docs merged, discoverable from README.
2. Contracts referenced by UI/backend code.
3. CI link-check (if enabled) passes.
