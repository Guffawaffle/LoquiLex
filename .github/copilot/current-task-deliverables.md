### Review Comments Found and Addressed

All comments were from `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` on PR #69:

1. **Worker Channel Architecture** (Line 185):
   - **Issue**: "The inline worker implementation creates a large, hard-to-maintain blob of JavaScript code within TypeScript"  
   - **Resolution**: Extracted 120+ lines of inline worker code, replaced with clean reference to separate `progress-worker.ts`

2. **Code Duplication** (Line 214):
   - **Issue**: "Exponential moving average calculation duplicated between worker-channel.ts and progress-worker.ts"
   - **Resolution**: Removed duplicated implementation from inline worker, now only exists in `progress-worker.ts`

3. **TypeScript Types** (Line 15):
   - **Issue**: "Redundant `| undefined` in optional property types"
   - **Status**: Already fixed in current codebase

4. **Deprecated API** (Line 89):
   - **Issue**: "Using deprecated `substr()` method instead of `slice()`"
   - **Resolution**: `return { job_id: \`job_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 11)}\` }`

5. **Deprecated API** (Line 101):
   - **Issue**: "Using deprecated `substr()` method instead of `slice()`"  
   - **Resolution**: `const jobId = \`job_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 11)}\``

### Code Changes Made

**File: `loquilex/ui/web/src/orchestration/worker/worker-channel.ts`**
- Removed 120+ lines of inline worker implementation (ProgressSmoother class)
- Updated `createProgressWorker()` function to use existing `progress-worker.ts`
- Added proper `WorkerMessageType` import for type safety
- Modified constructor to accept `Worker` instances directly
- Changed parameter type from `string` to `WorkerMessageType` in `sendMessage()`

**File: `loquilex/ui/web/src/orchestration/examples/downloads-store.ts`**
- Line 101: Replaced `substr(2, 9)` with `slice(2, 11)` in job ID generation
