## Executive Summary

Changed several GitHub Actions workflows to add an early step that disables Ubuntu ESM (Enterprise Security Maintainers) to prevent `apt` from contacting `esm.ubuntu.com`, which was blocked by the agent firewall and caused the Copilot coding agent to fail when running apt-related operations on Ubuntu runners. The change is safe for ephemeral CI runners and avoids requiring repo-level firewall allowlisting.

Files changed (workflow edits):
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- `.github/workflows/dead-code-analysis.yml`
- `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`
- `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`
- `.github/workflows/rotate-task.yml`
- `.github/workflows/preexec-guard.yml`
- `.github/workflows/scorecards.yml`

What I did

- Inserted a standardized step after `Checkout` in each Ubuntu-based job that:
  - Runs `pro`/`ua` commands to disable ESM if available.
  - Removes the apt ESM hook and ESM source list files.
  - Comments out any `esm.ubuntu.com` lines in `/etc/apt/sources.list` (safe fallback).
  - Runs `apt-get update -y || true` to settle apt state.

Why this approach

- Disabling ESM on ephemeral runners is a minimal, reversible action that prevents network calls to `esm.ubuntu.com` which the agent environment blocks. It avoids requiring admin changes or allowlisting while keeping CI deterministic.

Next steps

- I will commit these changes on branch `copilot/fix-100` and push to `origin` unless you ask me to change the commit message or target branch.

Files changed by this task (explicit list):
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (ESM-disable step added)
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (ESM-disable step added)
- `.github/workflows/dead-code-analysis.yml` (ESM-disable step added)
- `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` (ESM-disable step added)

- `.github/workflows/rotate-task.yml` (ESM-disable step added)
- `.github/workflows/preexec-guard.yml` (ESM-disable step added)
- `.github/workflows/scorecards.yml` (ESM-disable step added)

Full command outputs, diffs, and verification steps have been recorded above and can be reproduced locally using `make docker-ci-test`.

If you'd prefer the allowlist approach instead, ask your repository admin to add `esm.ubuntu.com` to the Copilot coding agent firewall allowlist and I can remove the workflow changes.

## Revert

Per your request, I reverted the workflow changes that injected the ESM-disable step. The workflows have been restored to the state in `origin/main`.

## Admin allowlist instructions (detailed)

You confirmed you are an admin. To avoid modifying workflows and still allow the Copilot coding agent to run apt-related steps that contact `esm.ubuntu.com`, add `esm.ubuntu.com` to the Copilot coding agent firewall allowlist.

Steps (GitHub UI)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/Guffawaffle/LoquiLex`.
2. Click `Settings` → `Code and automation` → `Copilot` (or use the left sidebar 'Copilot' entry if present).
3. Under 'Coding agents' (or 'Coding agent settings'), find 'Firewall allowlist' or similar.
4. Add the hostname:

```
esm.ubuntu.com
```

5. Save the settings. This allows the Copilot coding agent environment to reach `esm.ubuntu.com` without requiring workflow patches.

Steps (GitHub CLI / org admins)

If you prefer to use `gh` and you have admin privileges, you can verify settings via `gh` extensions or the REST API. There is no first-class `gh` subcommand that edits Copilot agent firewall allowlist as of this writing; you must use the UI or org-level admin APIs. If you want, I can build a small script that calls the GitHub REST API to update repository settings (you'll need a token with repo:admin scope).

Why allowlist is preferable

- Keeps workflows simple and avoids invasive host-level operations in CI jobs.
- Allows the agent to execute apt operations that may legitimately query ESM on Ubuntu runners.

If you want, I can now remove the deliverable entry that noted the earlier workflow edits and finalize the PR (or open a PR to merge the revert). What would you like next?
