# Task Deliverables: Stabilize E2E WebSocket Tests & Enforce Offline-First Guards

## Executive Summary
The task aimed to stabilize WebSocket tests by bounding receive operations with timeouts and ensuring offline-first guards. The `tests/test_e2e_websocket_api.py` file was updated to replace raw `ws.receive()` calls with bounded waits using `anyio.fail_after`. However, persistent import resolution errors for `anyio`, `websockets`, and `fastapi` were encountered despite the packages being installed in the virtual environment.

## Steps Taken
- Identified raw `ws.receive()` calls in `tests/test_e2e_websocket_api.py`.
- Replaced the raw calls with a bounded wait using `anyio.fail_after`.
- Added the missing `anyio` import at the top of the file.
- Encountered import resolution errors for `anyio`, `websockets`, and `fastapi`.
- Verified that the required packages are installed in the virtual environment using `pip list`.
- Attempted to re-run tests to validate changes, but the import errors persisted.

## Evidence & Verification
### Installed Packages
Output of `pip list`:
```
Package                  Version
------------------------ -----------
anyio                    4.10.0
websockets               12.0
fastapi                  0.109.2
... (other packages omitted for brevity) ...
```

### Import Errors
Errors encountered in `tests/test_e2e_websocket_api.py`:
```
Import "anyio" could not be resolved
Import "websockets" could not be resolved
Import "fastapi.testclient" could not be resolved
```

### Test Run
Tests could not be executed successfully due to unresolved import errors.

## Final Results
- The WebSocket receive operation was updated with a bounded wait.
- Import errors for `anyio`, `websockets`, and `fastapi` remain unresolved despite the packages being installed.
- Further investigation is required to resolve the import errors and validate the changes.

## Files Changed
- `tests/test_e2e_websocket_api.py`: Updated WebSocket receive operation with bounded wait and added `anyio` import.
