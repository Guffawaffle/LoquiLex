# Task Deliverables: Docs refresh â€” default to `make dev-minimal` and add `LX_SKIP_MODEL_PREFETCH`

## Executive Summary
The task aimed to make the lightweight, offline-first developer workflow the primary path by updating documentation, Makefile, and scripts. The `make dev-minimal` target was updated to never prefetch models, and the `LX_SKIP_MODEL_PREFETCH` environment variable was hardened for better truthiness checks. All changes were verified through linting, type checking, and unit tests.

## Steps Taken
- **Updated `README.md`:**
  - Added `make run-ci-mode` to the Quickstart section for parity with CI-TESTING.md.
- **Updated `CI-TESTING.md`:**
  - Added details about `make run-ci-mode`, `make run-local-ci`, and how `LX_SKIP_MODEL_PREFETCH` interacts with local development.
- **Modified `Makefile`:**
  - Updated the `dev-minimal` target to ensure it never prefetches models, aligning with the offline-first policy.
- **Updated `scripts/dev_fetch_models.py`:**
  - Hardened the truthiness check for `LX_SKIP_MODEL_PREFETCH` and replaced `exit()` with `sys.exit(0)` for better compatibility.
- **Verification:**
  - Re-ran linting (`ruff`), type checking (`mypy`), and unit tests (`pytest`).

## Evidence & Verification
### Commands Executed
```bash
make lint typecheck unit
```

### Outputs
- **Linting (ruff):**
  - All checks passed.
- **Type Checking (mypy):**
  - No issues found in 22 source files.
- **Unit Tests (pytest):**
  - 26 tests passed.
  - 8 warnings related to deprecation notices for legacy environment variables.

### Warnings
- Deprecation warnings for legacy `GF_*` environment variables were observed but are expected as part of the migration to `LX_*`.

## Final Results
- All task goals were met successfully.
- No errors or blockers remain.
- Follow-up recommendation: Address deprecation warnings in a future task.

## Files Changed
1. `README.md` - Updated Quickstart section.
2. `CI-TESTING.md` - Added offline-first details.
3. `Makefile` - Updated `dev-minimal` target.
4. `scripts/dev_fetch_models.py` - Hardened `LX_SKIP_MODEL_PREFETCH` guard.
