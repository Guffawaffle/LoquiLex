### Review Comments Details (PR #69)

**Found 5 review comments from copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]:**

#### 1. Worker Channel Architecture Issue
- **File**: `loquilex/ui/web/src/orchestration/worker/worker-channel.ts`
- **Line**: 185 (position in diff)
- **Issue**: Inline worker implementation creates maintenance problems
- **Comment**: "The inline worker implementation creates a large, hard-to-maintain blob of JavaScript code within TypeScript. Consider extracting this to a separate worker file or using a proper build process to bundle workers. This would improve code organization, enable proper syntax highlighting, and make the worker code testable independently."

#### 2. Code Duplication - Exponential Moving Average
- **File**: `loquilex/ui/web/src/orchestration/worker/worker-channel.ts`  
- **Lines**: 212-214 (duplicated with progress-worker.ts lines 49-53)
- **Issue**: Algorithm duplication across files
- **Comment**: "The exponential moving average calculation is duplicated between the inline worker (lines 212-214) and the separate progress-worker.ts file (lines 49-53). This duplication increases maintenance burden and risk of inconsistencies. Consider consolidating the algorithm implementation."

#### 3. TypeScript Type Annotation Redundancy
- **File**: `loquilex/ui/web/src/orchestration/utils/concurrency.ts`
- **Line**: 15
- **Issue**: Redundant `| undefined` in optional property type
- **Comment**: "The explicit `| undefined` in the type annotation is redundant since optional properties are already union types with undefined. This can be simplified to `cancellationToken?: CancellationToken`."
- **Suggested Fix**: `cancellationToken?: CancellationToken`

#### 4. Deprecated API Usage (First Instance)
- **File**: `loquilex/ui/web/src/orchestration/examples/downloads-store.ts`
- **Line**: 89
- **Issue**: Using deprecated `substr()` method
- **Comment**: "Using `substr()` is deprecated. Replace with `substring()` or `slice()` for better future compatibility. The recommended replacement would be: `Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 11)`."
- **Suggested Fix**: `return { job_id: \`job_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 11)}\` }`

#### 5. Deprecated API Usage (Second Instance)  
- **File**: `loquilex/ui/web/src/orchestration/examples/downloads-store.ts`
- **Line**: 101
- **Issue**: Using deprecated `substr()` method (second occurrence)
- **Comment**: "Using `substr()` is deprecated. Replace with `substring()` or `slice()` for better future compatibility. The recommended replacement would be: `Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 11)`."
