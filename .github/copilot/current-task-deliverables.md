# Executive Summary

This deliverable documents the execution of UI improvements for dual transcript panels, autoscroll pause/jump-to-live, stable partialâ†’final replacement, timestamps toggle, dark theme, a11y, and persistence features as described in `.github/copilot/current-task.md` for branch `copilot/fix-34`. All work was performed offline-first, with minimal diffs and full adherence to repo conventions. All CI gates and tests were run and outputs captured. Environment details and all commands are logged below.

# Steps Taken

- Verified branch: `copilot/fix-34` (current)
- Bootstrapped venv: `bash -lc 'test -x .venv/bin/python || (python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -U pip && (pip install -e . || true) && (pip install -r requirements-dev.txt || true))'`

- Ran unit tests: `make unit` (via VS Code task)
- Ran lint: `make lint` (ruff)
- Ran typecheck: `make typecheck` (mypy)
- Ran format: `make fmt` (black)
- Ran all checks: `make ci`
- Ran coverage: `pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q --cov=loquilex --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html:coverage_html`
- Ran safety scan: `safety check`
- Collected environment details: OS=Linux, Python=3.12.3, pytest=8.4.2, ruff=0.13.0, mypy=1.18.1
