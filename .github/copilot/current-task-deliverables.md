# Deliverables Report

## Executive Summary
This task implemented security enhancements for the LoquiLex repository, including Dependabot configuration, secret scanning, supply chain posture, and documentation updates. All workflows were verified to pass successfully.

## Steps Taken
- Created and switched to the `security/epic16-parts2-4` branch.
- Updated `.github/dependabot.yml` to configure Dependabot for pip, GitHub Actions, and npm.
- Added `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` to ensure Dependency Review gates high-severity issues.
- Verified that GitHub Secret Scanning and Push Protection are enabled.
- Created `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` and `.gitleaks.toml` for CI secret scanning.
- Added a `sec-scan` target to the Makefile for local secret scanning.
- Created `.github/workflows/scorecards.yml` for OpenSSF Scorecards.
- Added `SECURITY.md` to document the security policy and reporting process.
- Updated `README.md` to include a Security section referencing the security posture.
- Verified branch protection rules for `main` to include required status checks.
- Ran and verified all workflows, including tests, E2E, and coverage.
