# VS Code Problem Matcher & Task Hygiene - Deliverables

## Executive Summary

Successfully cleaned up the VS Code tasks.json configuration by:
1. Enhanced comments explaining Makefile delegation as source of truth
2. Removed unused mkdocs-related tasks (Generate Docs, Serve Docs, Publish Docs)
3. Confirmed all tasks use proper `problemMatcher: []` configuration (no `$pytest` references)
4. Verified task delegation to Makefile where appropriate

## Steps Taken

### 1. Analysis of Current State
- Examined `.vscode/tasks.json` and found it already used `problemMatcher: []` instead of `["$pytest"]`
- Checked for mkdocs configuration: no `mkdocs.yml` file found, no mkdocs in requirements files
- Verified no docs directory exists
- Confirmed most tasks properly delegate to Makefile targets

### 2. Enhanced Documentation Comments
**File: `.vscode/tasks.json` (lines 2-4)**

**Before:**
```json
// Tasks delegate to Makefile to prevent drift. Update commands only in Makefile.
```

**After:**
```json
// VS Code tasks delegate to Makefile as the source of truth to prevent configuration drift.
// To modify build/test/lint commands, update the Makefile instead of editing tasks here.
// All tasks use problemMatcher: [] to avoid VS Code's default matchers.
```

### 3. Removed Unused Tasks
**Removed three mkdocs tasks (lines 113-136 in original):**
- "Generate Docs" - `mkdocs build`
- "Serve Docs" - `mkdocs serve` 
- "Publish Docs" - `mkdocs gh-deploy --force`

These were removed because:
- No `mkdocs.yml` configuration file exists
- mkdocs is not listed in any requirements files
- No `docs/` directory exists
- Tasks would fail if executed

### 4. Verified Proper Task Structure
All remaining tasks properly:
- Use `problemMatcher: []` (not `$pytest`)
- Delegate to Makefile where appropriate (`make unit`, `make lint`, `make fmt`, etc.)
- Include proper dependencies like `"dependsOn": ["Bootstrap venv"]`

## Evidence & Verification

### Before Changes
```bash
$ find . -name "*mkdocs*" -o -name "docs" -type d
# No output - no mkdocs files

$ grep -r mkdocs requirements*
# No output - mkdocs not in requirements

$ grep -r "\$pytest" .vscode/
# No output - no $pytest problem matchers
```

### After Changes  
```json
{
  // VS Code tasks delegate to Makefile as the source of truth to prevent configuration drift.
  // To modify build/test/lint commands, update the Makefile instead of editing tasks here. 
  // All tasks use problemMatcher: [] to avoid VS Code's default matchers.
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    // ... all tasks retained except mkdocs ones
  ]
}
```

**Validation:**
- JSON syntax is valid for VS Code (JSONC format with comments)
- All tasks use `problemMatcher: []`
- No references to unused tools like mkdocs
- Clear documentation about Makefile delegation

## Final Results

âœ… **All requirements met:**
- [x] Replace "problemMatcher": ["$pytest"] with [] - **Already done, confirmed all tasks use []**
- [x] Remove duplicate/unused tasks - **Removed 3 unused mkdocs tasks**  
- [x] Add brief comments atop tasks.json pointing to Makefile - **Enhanced with detailed comments**

The VS Code tasks.json is now clean, well-documented, and free of unused tasks. All tasks properly delegate to the Makefile as the source of truth for build commands.

## Files Changed

- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Enhanced comments, removed 3 unused mkdocs tasks
