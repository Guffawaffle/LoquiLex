# LoquiLex Current Task Deliverables
# Current Task ‚Äî PR #27 Polish: docs accuracy, tiny test nit, and CI trigger hygiene

## Executive Summary
Executed the task to polish PR #27 on branch `chore/base-camp` targeting `main`. The primary changes involved updating the CodeQL workflow to use consistent trigger style by omitting the branches filter for push events, and adding commentary to `constraints.txt` explaining the pinning policy. No duplicate import was found in `tests/test_compat_versions.py`, and documentation references were already accurate since the referenced files exist. All quality gates passed successfully.

## Steps Taken
1. **Read current task**: Retrieved and analyzed `.github/copilot/current-task.md` to understand objectives.
2. **Verified import in test file**: Checked `tests/test_compat_versions.py` for duplicate `import httpx` - none found, as the import is correctly consolidated.
3. **Checked documentation accuracy**: Verified `.github/copilot/README.md` references to `main.prompt.md` and `rotate-task.sh` - both files exist, so no removal needed.
4. **Confirmed versioning instructions**: Verified README.md version bump instructions reference `pyproject.toml`, which exists in the repo.
5. **Updated CodeQL workflow**: Modified `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` to omit `branches: ['**']` for push events, making it consistent with implicit all-branches behavior.
6. **Added constraints commentary**: Prepended comments to `constraints.txt` explaining Path A (Keep Pin) policy for deterministic dev/CI.
7. **Ran quality gates**:
   - Lint (ruff): Passed with no issues.
   - Format (black): Passed, 45 files left unchanged.
   - Typecheck (mypy): Passed with one note (annotation-unchecked) but no issues.
   - Unit tests: Passed 33 tests with 3 deprecation warnings (expected for httpx compatibility).

## Evidence & Verification
### Lint Output
```
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check loquilex tests
All checks passed!
```

### Format Output
```
.venv/bin/python -m black loquilex tests
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
45 files left unchanged.
```

### Typecheck Output
```
.venv/bin/python -m mypy loquilex
loquilex/cli/live_en_to_zh.py:421: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
Success: no issues found in 22 source files
```

### CodeQL Workflow Diff
```diff
on:
-  push:
-    branches: ['**']
+  push:
   pull_request:
     branches: [main]
   schedule:
     - cron: "0 4 * * 0" # weekly
```

### Constraints.txt Diff
```diff
+# Path A (Keep Pin): deterministic dev/CI. Bump via Path B (Coordinated Upgrade)
+# when FastAPI/Starlette/httpx are upgraded together after local + E2E validation.
 # Central constraints for deterministic installs across CI/dev
 # Keep in sync when updating core tooling versions.
```

## Final Results
All acceptance criteria have been met:
- ‚úÖ No duplicate import in `tests/test_compat_versions.py` (none existed).
- ‚úÖ Copilot README does not reference missing files (files exist).
- ‚úÖ Version bump instructions match repo reality (`pyproject.toml` exists).
- ‚úÖ CodeQL workflow triggers are valid and consistent (omitted branches filter for push).
- ‚úÖ `constraints.txt` clearly states the pinning policy with added comments.

The task goals were fully achieved. No remaining issues or follow-ups required.

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`: Updated push trigger to omit branches filter for consistency.
- `constraints.txt`: Added comments explaining pinning policy.
