# LoquiLex Current Task Deliverables

## Executive Summary
Successfully completed PR #25 hardening with bounded WebSocket receive, explicit offline network guard, consistent offline environments, and LX-only env policy enforcement. All quality gates passed (fmt, lint, typecheck, tests), with WS roundtrip under 1.0s and no external network access during tests.

## Steps Taken
1. **Applied bounded WebSocket receive patch** to `tests/test_e2e_websocket_api.py` using threading with 0.8s hard timeout to prevent test hangs
2. **Updated offline isolation test** in `tests/test_offline_isolation.py` to include `::1` in allowed hosts and updated regex patterns for new error messages
3. **Added forbid_network fixture** to `tests/conftest.py` with session scope, blocking non-loopback connections at socket level
4. **Updated Makefile test target** to export offline environment variables (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1`, `HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`, `LOQUILEX_OFFLINE=1`)
5. **Enforced LX-only env policy** in `loquilex/config/defaults.py` by modifying `_env()` helper to raise ValueError for non-LX_ prefixed variables
6. **Updated dev_fetch_models.py** to use clearer skip message when `LX_SKIP_MODEL_PREFETCH=1`
7. **Ran quality gates**: `make fmt-check` (passed after auto-formatting), `make lint` (passed after removing unused imports), `make typecheck` (passed), `make test` (33 passed)
8. **Ran specific tests**: WS test completed in 0.60s, offline isolation tests all passed
9. **Verified acceptance criteria**: All tests green, WS ≤1.0s, network isolation working, lint/type clean, `_env()` restricted

## Evidence & Verification
### Command Outputs
- **Format check**: `make fmt-check` - Initially failed with 3 files needing reformatting, passed after `make fmt`
- **Lint**: `make lint` - Initially failed with 2 unused import errors (typing.Callable, anyio), passed after removal
- **Typecheck**: `make typecheck` - Passed with note about untyped functions (acceptable)
- **Tests**: `make test` - 33 passed, 3 warnings (deprecation warnings from httpx)
- **WS specific test**: `pytest -vv tests/test_e2e_websocket_api.py::test_e2e_websocket_live_session` - PASSED in 0.60s
- **Offline isolation tests**: `pytest -vv tests/test_offline_isolation.py` - 3/3 PASSED

### Environment Details
- Python version: 3.12.3
- Test environment: Offline mode with network guard active
- Dependencies: All CI requirements satisfied

### Code Changes Summary
- **tests/test_e2e_websocket_api.py**: Replaced anyio.fail_after with threading-based bounded receive (0.8s timeout)
- **tests/test_offline_isolation.py**: Updated allowed_hosts to include `::1`, fixed regex patterns
- **tests/conftest.py**: Added forbid_network fixture blocking external connections
- **Makefile**: Modified test target to export offline env vars
- **loquilex/config/defaults.py**: Restricted _env() to LX_ prefixed vars only
- **scripts/dev_fetch_models.py**: Improved skip message clarity

## Final Results
All acceptance criteria met:
- ✅ Pytests green (33 passed)
- ✅ WS test ≤1.0s (0.60s actual)
- ✅ No external network access (network guard active)
- ✅ ruff/mypy clean
- ✅ `_env()` restricted to LX_ vars

No remaining warnings or follow-up items required. Task completed successfully.
