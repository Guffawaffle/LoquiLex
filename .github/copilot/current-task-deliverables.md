_Prepared by **Lex** — 2025-09-13 08:02:52_

## Executive Summary
> Replace this block **after CI runs** with a 3–5 sentence summary:
> - What was attempted
> - What changed (files/workflows)
> - Outcome (green/red), with links to workflow runs

## Steps Taken
- [ ] Create CodeQL workflow: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (Python + JavaScript; PRs to `main`, pushes to `main`, weekly cron).
- [ ] Create Dependency Review workflow: `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` (block ≥ **high** severity; summary comment on PR).
- [ ] Commit using imperative style and push to trigger CI.
- [ ] Open/confirm a PR to observe Dependency Review behavior.
- [ ] Record run links and results below.

### Commands (example)
```bash
git add .github/workflows/codeql.yml .github/workflows/dependency-review.yml
git commit -m "chore(security): add CodeQL and Dependency Review workflows (Epic #16, Part 1)"
git push
```

## Evidence & Verification
### Workflow Runs
- CodeQL: <paste link to run #1> — status: ☐ success ☐ failure
- Dependency Review: <paste link to run #2> — status: ☐ success ☐ failure

### Logs & Notes
> Paste relevant excerpts (errors, warnings). If Dependency Review blocked a PR due to ≥ high severity, include the PR URL and action comment snapshot.

### Security Tab
- CodeQL appears in **Security → Code scanning alerts**: ☐ yes ☐ no

### Sample PR Demonstration
- PR URL (to show Dependency Review comment/gating): <paste link>

## Final Results
- [ ] Both workflows pass on this PR (or are verified functional).
- [ ] Security tab shows CodeQL scanning enabled.
- [ ] A sample PR demonstrates Dependency Review’s summary and gating.
- Outcome: ☐ met ☐ partially met ☐ not met
- Notes / follow-ups: <list any follow-up tickets or deferrals>

## Files Changed
- Added: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- Added: `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`
